# DiscordConnector 

# DEPRECATED: This project currently not being maintained as there are some changes to the various moving parts Bot Framework. 

### This project may be revived later when the [V4 botbuilder-js](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js) SDK reaches production-quality status and a new [BotAdapter-based implementation](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js/blob/master/libraries/botbuilder-core/src/botAdapter.ts) may be created.

#### Version 0.7.3 - [NPM][npm]
___

## Description:

**DiscordConnector** allows bots written using **[Microsoft's Bot Framework][botframework]** to be used in the popular VoIP client, **[Discord][discordapp]**. DiscordConnector uses the Bot Framework's **[Direct Line API][directline]** to connect a Bot Framework Bot to Discord. This connector implements **[Discord.js][discord.js]** to map Direct Line's Activity objects to Discord-consumable events.

The **ConnectorStorage** provides multiple conversation support. A succinct description is that the DiscordConnector uses an external storage to store Direct Line Conversation ID and Discord Channel ID pairings; this allows your users to continue conversations with their bot. The **TestConnectorStorage** provides the same support but caches the pairings internally. Use the TestConnectorStorage for rapid prototyping/trying out DiscordConnector.

The **DiscordHelperModule** focuses on providing Discord-specific functionalities and commands, e.g. having a bot join or leave a channel, getting a list of users from the Discord.js client, etc.

## Setup:
```

[`uws`][uws] is a peer dependency of Discord.js and must be installed. All other unmet dependency messages can be safely ignored.


### Voice & ffmpeg:
At the moment voice is not yet supported with this adapter, though its support is planned.
